  Pure Functional Scripting Language With Mood Shifts
</p>

======

Schizo is an embedded Lisp dialect aiming to simplify software complexity by extending Lisp with:
* The Purity of Erlang.
* Modernization of the lisp syntax, by making "C" style syntax sugarring. For now this is optional but recommended:
  - brackets "{}" with semicolumns ";" to write lists.
  - Indexing using "[]".
* Optional infix escape sequences for ease of reading.
* Simple C++ foreign function interface.
