  Pure Functional Scripting Language With Mood Shifts
</p>

======

Schizo is an embedded Lisp dialect aiming to simplify software complexity by modernizing Lisp with:
* Immutability.
* "C" style syntax sugarring. While this is optional, it is recommended:
  - brackets "{}" with semicolumns ";" for un-evaluated lists.
  - Indexing using square brackets "[]".
* Parser control via "#[expr...]#":
  - infix escape sequences for ease of reading.
  - ...
* Simple C++ foreign function interface.
